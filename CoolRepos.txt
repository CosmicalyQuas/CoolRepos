Cool GitHub Repositories:

1. Computer Science courses with video lectures-
	- https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses
Description: This repository is a massive organized compilation of video
lectures on all different aspects of computer science. This is really 
cool since it covers so many topics that I am interested in. It also can
be used for reference on some of our past classes such as Data Structures,
Systems programming, and also Software Engineering in the future.

2. Nintendo Switch emulator-
	- https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu
Description: This c++ project is an emulator for the nintendo switch and
can run most games from the switch. There are more than 200 contributors
on the project and you can also sponsor the team on patreon. Obviously it
is fun anytime you get a chance to mess around with and enjoy any
Nintendo games and not needing to have the switch itself to enjoy some of 
those games is definitely a great thing.

3. Cataclysm - Dark Days Ahead
	- https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA
Description: This turn-based survival game is written in C++ and more than 
1500 contributors! I've always heard that making contributions to open source
projects would be great for early portfolio work and this seems like a really
awesome project to jump in and help out on. They deal with some procedural 
generation, vehicles, combat, and many other mechanics that would be interesting
to dive into.

4. TheAlgorithms - C-Sharp
	- https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C-Sharp
Description: This C# project covers an unbelievable number of algorithms. This
resource could be extremely useful for coding interviews in the future once I
research what algorithms are the most common and then I can find the C#
implementation instead of having to translate it from another language myself.
They cover implementing queues as arrays, lists, and stack, as well as
implementing a stack as an array or list. There are just too many topics to
list, but overall it is certainly one I will keep my eye on.

5. Karan - GitIgnore for Command Line
	- https://github.com/karan/joe
Description: This project makes it easy to generate .gitignore files from your
command line. The usage is very simple with short and easy commands that allow
you to access, update, and generate gitignore files. It has plenty of other
useful functionality as well such as overwriting an existing file, appending on
an existing file, and dealing with multiple languages.
